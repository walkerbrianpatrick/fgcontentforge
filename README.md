# fgcontentforge
A repo for creating open source content for use with Fantasy Grounds

Current goals are to generate examples for each type of content:

1. Classes
2. Items
3. Maps
4. Portraits
5. Campaigns

If things seems to be working well, maybe a map generator and other tools/extensions. 

Developed primarily for FG Unity on Linux, so there are no guarantees that any of the content will work on Mac or Windows.
